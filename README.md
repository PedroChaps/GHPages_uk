Dear curious person or potential future employer,

This repo was a hack s.t. I can have a custom domain pointing to what I want to show.
Specifically, the content of this repo is a website with just an iframe of an embedded youtube video and a cool background ~~ChatGPT~~ I created.

I don't believe this is representative of my work and, in a work environment, I will not take shortcuts like this (unless the team expects me to ðŸ¤”).

For a more proper example of my work (but still a bit naive, as it was some years ago and my first web dev experience), have a look at the creation of my [personal website](https://github.com/PedroChaps/pedrochaps.github.io), or explore my university projects also available in GitHub.

Thanks! :D
